// Filename should be middleware.tsx and it's always outside the app folder
// We use middleware for authentication or is user loggedin or not and redirect user to specific page
// middleware code execute serverside and you can see this in your server file like where you run your project npm run dev
// middleware execute whenever you access any route
// The below console not show in your browser it's show in serverside
// If you load entire site then middleware execute time = your total routes 

// Every page Redirect to login page use below statement

// return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login",request.url))
// But after this statement we see error on webpage and the error would be below:

// This page isnâ€™t workinglocalhost redirected you too many times.
// Try deleting your cookies.
// ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS

// For handling above error we apply if condition and write our statement in it
